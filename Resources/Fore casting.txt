Modelling yield estimation based on fruit detection :
 The yield can be affected by several factors (climate, fertilization, diseases, etc.) and does not conform to a classical linear
model. Currently, neural networks such as Long Short-Term Memory
(LSTM) for recurrent neural networks can understand and recognize
complex patterns in data (Fischer and Krauss, 2018). In this work, a
model based on LSTM and encoding with Keras was used to estimate
yield based on the fruit count of each tree. To train the model, the total
number of fruits per tree (Nft) (model prediction) for each face with the actual yield per
tree (Yapt)(labelled) and the total actual yield (Tayield) (ground truth) for each season were
analysed. The data were assembled in pairs of two years for training,
and the remaining one was used for testing. Finally, the model was
trained for yield estimation per tree (Yept) and for total yield estimation
(Teyield) separately.
